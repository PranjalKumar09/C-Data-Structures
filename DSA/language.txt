By C we can make system software

Moving to c++ it solve real world problems & more secured

Java is Platform independent applications
        

Platform
    It is an environment in which program runs
    Combination of OS & Processor

    Machine is individual

    x person have y relgion
    x > y
    Example ->  All person have y Platform
                & all person have x machines

In the code snippet int arr[5]; arr[5] = 12;, you're trying to assign a value to arr[5]. However, this is actually out of bounds since array indices in C/C++ are 0-based, meaning a 5-element array has valid indices from 0 to 4.
Why no error?

    No compile-time error: C/C++ does not perform bounds checking during compilation, so the compiler assumes that you, as the programmer, will access the array correctly.
    No runtime error (in some cases): At runtime, accessing arr[5] is undefined behavior. This means the program may appear to run without errors, but it could cause memory corruption or unpredictable behavior. Depending on the system and the program's layout in memory, you might not see an immediate issue, but it's still incorrect.

In short, there's no error because C/C++ allows direct memory access, even if it's unsafe. However, this will lead to undefined behavior. To avoid this, always ensure you're accessing within the valid bounds of an array.


    =>  But java provides the Automatic Memory Management, java provide gc() it checks any dyanmic release. gc() it will  Automatically runs.

    =>  Java is secure don't use pointers explicitly


    int a ;
    int *p;
    p = &a;

  Reference doesn't have seprate variable, while pointer does, java runs all program in sandbox,

  * Java is robust in Error excdption management
  * Java is inherited from C/C++

  Multithreading-> Multithreading occur withing single application, in mutliple applications it is multiproccessing


  In python there is RMI by which object of same application between two different machines

  Java is distributed means, any modules can loaded with internet connection

  JVM does interpreter & Garbage collection



  JRE is Java Runtime Environment

  JDK = JRE + x
  JRE = JVM + y

  JDK is used to compile ,debug , execute, java program
  JRE is used to provide Platform to run program

  JVM perform -> Execution of program
              -> Memory providing



    Out in java is object Reference (not object) .



    Java support UNICODE (large no of international languages ), C only support ASCII code so in java char size is 2 bytes but C it is 1 byte




    Converting data type to object

    data type method



    exception occur if string not containing  digits in parse int


    
    


    Scanner class to get input


    Ending control loop, & exit control loop
    







    Demo D; // now it object Reference , no memory created
    D = new Demo(---);  // this is new object

    Factory methods
        To check anything before making objects
