Recursion : function calling itself 
* way to break complicated problems 
Big type problem depend on same type function 

Reursive : F(x) = G ( F(x-1) , F(x-2)  )
base case : where for f(x) 
           * must have return  
           * tells where to stop 
           * else segmentaion error 
Recusrive relation -> Processing
both mandotory recursive function and base case            


Recusive tree -> a graphical representation that illustrates execution flow of a recursive function. It provides a visual breakdown of recursive calls, showcasing  progression of algorithm as it branches out and eventually reaches a base case. The tree structure helps in analyzing  time complexity and understanding  recursive process involved.
