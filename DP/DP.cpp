Some Genral Shortcuts

1)Whenever 'try all possible ways', 'count' , 'best way' then you have to apply recursion 

2) Try to do represent the problem  with index even whenever possible, not only in array 
Always do all stuff from index
Whenever question says sum all stufs -> count all ways
                       min(of all stuffs) -> for minimum


Think edge cases 


in dpp loops also think in max min if you can start loop from 1 and same 1 or 2 rounds of loop if possible
