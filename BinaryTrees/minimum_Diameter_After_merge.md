## Problem Explanation

This problem asks us to find the minimum possible diameter of a tree formed by merging two given trees. The two trees are represented by edge lists, and the objective is to find the optimal way of merging them to minimize the diameter of the resulting tree. The diameter of a tree is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.

### Algorithm Explanation

1. **Understanding the Diameter**: The diameter of a tree is defined as the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path can be determined by finding the longest path starting from any leaf node to another leaf node. The tree's height is the maximum distance from the root to any leaf node.

2. **Steps to Solve the Problem**:
    - **Calculate Height and Diameter for Each Tree**: For both input trees, we need to compute the height and diameter.
    - **Merging the Trees**: When two trees are merged, we can connect the two trees with an edge, and the resulting tree's diameter can be affected by this edge. The new diameter is calculated as the sum of the heights of the two trees (plus one for the new edge) and the maximum diameter of the two trees.
    - **Tree Traversal for Height and Diameter Calculation**: We perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate the height and diameter of the trees. This is done by removing leaves and propagating the tree's structure until we reach the tree's center.

### Solution

The provided solution uses a BFS-based approach to compute the height and diameter of a tree efficiently.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDiameterAfterMerge(vector<vector<int>>& edges1, vector<vector<int>>& edges2) {
        // Calculate the height and diameter of each tree
        int n1 = edges1.size() + 1;
        int n2 = edges2.size() + 1;
        
        pair<int, int> tree1 = findHeightAndDiameter(n1, edges1);
        pair<int, int> tree2 = findHeightAndDiameter(n2, edges2);

        // The height of each tree
        int h1 = tree1.first;
        int h2 = tree2.first;

        // The minimum diameter after merging the trees is calculated by connecting the two trees:
        
        return max(h1 + h2 + 1, max(tree1.second, tree2.second)); // Adding 1 for the new edge that connects the trees.
    }

    pair<int, int> findHeightAndDiameter(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        if (n <= 2) return {n - 1, n - 1}; // Special case for very small trees

        // Build the adjacency list
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        vector<int> degree(n, 0);

        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
            degree[edge[0]]++;
            degree[edge[1]]++;
        }

        // Use a queue to process leaf nodes
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (degree[i] == 1) q.push(i);
        }

        int lastLevelSize = 0;
        int height = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
                    degree[neighbor]--;
                    if (degree[neighbor] == 1) q.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
            lastLevelSize = size;
            height++;
        }

        height--; // Adjust for the last level

        // The diameter is twice the height for a tree
        int diameter = height * 2;

        // If there are still more than 2 nodes left, it implies we have a center node or two center nodes
        if (lastLevelSize > 1) {
            diameter++;
            height++;
        }

        return {height, diameter};
    }
};
```

### Key Concepts

- **Height**: The height of a tree is the longest path from the root to any leaf node.
- **Diameter**: The diameter of a tree is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.
- **Center of the Tree**: The center of a tree is the node (or two nodes) from which the tree can be spanned such that the distance to all other nodes is minimized.

### Time Complexity

- For each tree, we need to process all nodes and edges to compute the height and diameter. The BFS-based approach ensures that each node and edge is processed only once.
    - Time complexity for calculating height and diameter for each tree: **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes.
    - Since there are two trees, the total complexity is **O(n1 + n2)**, where `n1` and `n2` are the number of nodes in the two trees.

### Space Complexity

- We need space for the adjacency list and degree array.
    - Space complexity for each tree: **O(n)**.
    - Total space complexity: **O(n1 + n2)**, where `n1` and `n2` are the number of nodes in the two trees.

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently computes the minimum diameter after merging two trees using BFS to calculate the height and diameter of each tree. The solution is optimal in terms of time and space complexity and provides a clean and understandable way to solve the problem.
