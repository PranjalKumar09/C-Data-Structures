ARTHMETIC EXPRESSION EVALUATION 

    Expression usually represented as Infix notation. The order of operation & operands in an arhmetic expression does'nt uniquely determine the order in wich operation are to performed


    1. Polish Notation (Prefix Notation)
        : operator -> operand -> operand2
        It refers to notation in which operator is placed before its two operands. No parethesis required 
        +AB

    2. Reverse Notation (Postfix Notation) operand -> operand2 -> operator
        Analogous notation in wihc the operator is placed after its two operands . Again, no parethesis required in reverse polish notation 
        AB+    

    

    Precedence => Highest : Exponentiation 
                  Medium  : Multiplication & Division
                  Lowest  : Addition & Subtraction


    Infix -> (2*4) * (4*6)
    Postfix -> 24+46+*
